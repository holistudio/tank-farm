```js
import { PLAYER_1, SYSTEM } from '@rcade/plugin-input-classic'

// D-pad
if (PLAYER_1.DPAD.up) { /* ... */ }
if (PLAYER_1.DPAD.down) { /* ... */ }
if (PLAYER_1.DPAD.left) { /* ... */ }
if (PLAYER_1.DPAD.right) { /* ... */ }

// Buttons
if (PLAYER_1.A) { /* ... */ }
if (PLAYER_1.B) { /* ... */ }

// Spinner Angle
tank.turretAngle = SPINNER_1.SPINNER.angle

// Same for PLAYER 2

// System
if (SYSTEM.TWO_PLAYER) { /* Start game */ }
```
